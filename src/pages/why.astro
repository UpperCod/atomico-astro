							<site-text>
								<strong>Atomico is 8.6x faster than React</strong> on first render.

						<site-count value={2}>

								Atomico only needs 75% of the lines of code that Lit needs to solve the same goal.

						Atomico is light in size and in lines of code. Writing fewer lines of code will help you improve your productivity when developing and scaling your interface.

# Astro + Atomico SSR

Astro build is a powerful tool for the development of sites and applications, I have decided to use this tool to test the new functionality of Atomico in SSR mode.

This site is an early project, which will be improved as astro build is known, you are invited to participate in the improvements of this site.

Functionalities to design, develop and integrate

1. atomicojs.dev/comunity: page focused on publicizing utilities and examples generated by the community.
2. atomicojs.dev/showcase: page focused on publicizing practical use cases, be it design system, application development and microfrontend.
3. atomicojs.dev/academy: page focused on offering an interactive learning experience.

The components of this site are available at [@atomico/site](https://github.com/atomicojs/site)
